## Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, please follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/drryjoh/chemgen.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using Python 3:

   ```bash
   python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you donâ€™t have a `requirements.txt` file, you can manually install the dependencies as follows:

   ```bash
   python3 -m pip install cantera pyyaml
   ```

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python packages to run:

- **[Cantera](https://cantera.org)**: Cantera is an open-source suite of tools for problems involving chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, and transport processes.
  
  Install it using:

  ```bash
  python3 -m pip install cantera
  ```

- **[PyYAML](https://pyyaml.org/)**: A Python library for parsing and emitting YAML.
  
  Install it using:

  ```bash
  python3 -m pip install pyyaml
  ```

Ensure you are using Python 3 and `pip` is invoked through `python3 -m pip` for consistent environment management.
